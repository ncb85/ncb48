; CE AND CLOCK CONTROLDriving the CE input high initiates all data transfers.
; The CE input serves two functions. First, CE turns on the control logic
; that allows access to the shift register for the address/command sequence.
; Second, the CE signal provides a method of terminating either single-byte or
; multiple-byte CE data transfer.A clock cycle is a sequence of a rising edge
; followed by a falling edge. For data inputs, data must be valid during
; the rising edge of the clock and data bits are output on the falling edge
; of clock. If the CE input is low, all data transfer terminates and the I/O pin
; goes to a high-impedance state. Figure 4 shows data transfer. At power-up,
; CE must be a logic 0 until VCC > 2.0V. Also, SCLK must be at a logic 0 when
; CE is driven to a logic 1 state.DATA INPUTFollowing the eight SCLK cycles that
; input a write command byte, a data byte is input on the rising edge of the next
; eight SCLK cycles. Additional SCLK cycles are ignored should they inadvertently
; occur. Data is input starting with bit 0.DATA OUTPUTFollowing the eight SCLK
; cycles that input a read command byte, a data byte is output on the falling
; edge of the next eight SCLK cycles. Note that the first data bit to be
; transmitted occurs on the first falling edge after the last bit of the command
; byte is written. Additional SCLK cycles retransmit the data bytes should they
; inadvertently occur so long as CE remains high. This operation permits continuous
; burst mode read capability. Also, the I/O pin is tristated upon each rising edge
; of SCLK. Data is output starting with bit 0.
; DS1302 can be run in either 12-hour or 24-hour mode. Bit 7 of the hours register
; is defined as the 12- or 24-hour mode-select bit. When high, the 12-hour mode
; is selected. In the 12-hour mode, bit 5 is the AM/PM  bit  with  logic high
; being PM. In the 24-hour mode, bit 5 is the second 10-hour bit (20â€“23 hours).
; The hours data must be re-initialized whenever the 12/24 bit is changed.
; Bit 7 of the seconds register is defined as the clock halt (CH) flag. When
; this bit is set to logic 1, the clock oscillator is stopped and the DS1302 is
; placed into a low-power standby mode with a current drain of less than 100nA,
; when this bit is written to logic 0, the clock will start.
; Initial power-on state is not defined.
